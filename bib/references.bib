@article{Wang2024Survey,
  abstract = {This survey explores the memory mechanisms of large language model (LLM)-based agents, which are increasingly pivotal in advancing towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It categorizes these mechanisms into Short-term Memory, Long-term Memory, External Memory, and Hybrid Memory, discussing their definitions, necessity, and practical implementations. The paper examines how these mechanisms contribute to agent capabilities in planning, reflection, and tool utilization, and identifies challenges such as hallucination and context window limitations.},
